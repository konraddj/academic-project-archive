# Secure LAN Network with WAN Integration

## Summary
This project involves the design and implementation of a secure LAN network for an office building, integrated with WAN connectivity to extend the corporate network. The focus is on creating a robust network infrastructure with an emphasis on security, utilizing firewalls and DMZ to protect network traffic and servers.

## Introduction
The client for this project is EXCEL FINANCE, a financial investment company headquartered in Dublin, expanding to County Donegal. The new office requires a well-designed LAN network to accommodate conference rooms, department offices, and executive, and administrative areas, located on the ground floor of the building. The primary objective is to ensure a secure and efficient network setup, addressing connectivity and security concerns.

## General Network Specification

### Components
- **Active Devices:** Routers, Switches, Access Points, Servers
- **Passive Devices:** Cables, Patch Panels, Racks, Sockets

### Features of the LAN Network
- **Scalability:** Ability to grow with the organization’s needs.
- **Redundancy:** Ensuring continuous operation with backup systems.
- **Performance:** High-speed data transfer and minimal latency.
- **Security:** Protection against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Simple management and troubleshooting processes.

### Hierarchical Network Model
- **Access Layer:** Connects end devices to the network via switches.
- **Distribution Layer:** Facilitates data exchange between access and core layers.
- **Core Layer:** Handles traffic from the entire network and delivers data beyond.

### Structured Cabling
- **Horizontal Cabling:** Connects network sockets on the same floor to distribution points.
- **Vertical Cabling:** Interconnects different floors.
- **Campus Cabling:** Connects multiple buildings.
- **Distribution Points:** Houses network equipment like switches and routers.

### Distribution Point
- **Requirements:** Space should be at least 3 meters in length, 2.6 meters in height, and 2.2 meters in width. Includes routers, switches, servers, and patch panels.

## Audit

### Purpose and Design Assumptions
- **Objective:** Provide reliable access to network resources and the Internet, ensuring security and scalability.
- **Socket Planning:** One socket per 10m² of office space, with future expansion in mind.
- **Existing Infrastructure:** Internet connection, with existing electrical installations certified.
- **Cabling:** Use F/UTP, cat. 6 for network sockets and U/UTP, cat. 5e for MDF and IDF.
- **MDF Equipment:** Includes routers, switches, servers, patch panels, ASA, and a recommended UPS.

## Results
The project successfully designed and implemented a secure LAN network with WAN integration, meeting all specified requirements and ensuring a scalable, high-performance, and secure infrastructure for EXCEL FINANCE.
