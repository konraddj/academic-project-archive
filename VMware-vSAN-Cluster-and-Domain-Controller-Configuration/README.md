# Build a VMware Cluster with vSAN
## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a comprehensive guide for building and configuring a VMware cluster with vSAN. It is intended for technical personnel responsible for setting up a production environment with VMware vSphere and vSAN technologies.

## Purpose

The goal of this SOP is to deliver a detailed, step-by-step guide for deploying three VMware clusters with clustered shared storage (vSAN) and configuring a Domain Controller. This SOP ensures a smooth and efficient implementation of a production environment by addressing critical tasks such as hardware verification, software installation, and network configuration.

## Key Tasks Covered

1. **Prerequisites Verification**
   - Confirm hardware and resource requirements.

2. **Domain Controller Setup**
   - Configure a server as a Domain Controller.

3. **VMware ESXi Installation**
   - Install VMware ESXi on three hosts.

4. **vCenter Configuration**
   - Install and configure VMware vCenter.

5. **Updates and Networking**
    - Apply necessary updates and configure network settings.

6. **vSAN Implementation**
    - Set up and configure VMware vSAN for shared storage.

7. **Verification Testing**
    - Perform tests to ensure the environment is properly configured and functional.

## Results

The implementation of this SOP results in a fully operational VMware cluster with:

- **Reliable Storage**: VMware vSAN provides a unified, scalable storage solution by pooling local storage resources from multiple vSphere hosts.
- **Efficient Management**: Centralized management through VMware vCenter enhances control over the virtualized environment.
- **Robust Infrastructure**: Proper configuration of networking and storage ensures high availability and resilience.
