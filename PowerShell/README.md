# Powershell Exercises #
## Project Scope ##
![img.png](powershellscripts.png)
This guide contains hands-on work on completing tasks with Powershell version 7. There are four folders here, with scripts and lists of commands needed to invoke the necessary information, arithmetic, installation and configuration. These exercises were part of the work of a student from the Infrastructure as Code module in the PGDip in Cloud Computing course at Atlantic Technological University.
#
## Project composition ##
The project consists of a root directory containing four folders, each of which consists of executable files and command list files.
#
### Walkthroughs 1 - Installing Powershell 7
- In this Walkthrought, steps are taken to install Powershell version 7.3 on a Windows PC.
### Walkthroughs 2 -  PowerShell Variables and Loops
- This Folder contains powershell files for exercises with variables and loops. This collection of files shows how arithmetic operations are performed in powershell.
### Walkthroughs 3 - Remote Control
- This collection of files contains information on how to configure Virtual Machines in Powershell. Configuration is based on network settings and on adding appropriate Windows features. Features such as domain controller, DNS, DHCP, user management are added. The guide shows how to set up and join a domain on computers on the same local network. The csv file was omitted because it contained information about students. It is recommended to create your own according to the variables contained in the appropriate executable file "PGDipCLOD2022.ps1" There are also some additional network configuration files that you might want to take a look at.
### Walkthroughs 4 - DSC
- With PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC), you can monitor the status of configured resources, which allows you to maintain computer consistency, and can also automatically configure systems to always be in the desired state. PowerShell takes the configured components and converts them to Managed Object Format (MOF) files. This technical guide shows how this can be achieved on a previously configured Windows Server 2019 VM in Walkthroughts 3.
