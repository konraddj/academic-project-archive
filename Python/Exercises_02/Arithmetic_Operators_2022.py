print(a)

#Subtraction
b = 3-1
print(b)

#Exponentiation
c = 2**3
print(c)

#Multiplication
d = 2*2
print(d)

#Divison
e = 9/3
print(e)

#Modulus
f = 10%3
print(f)

#Floor division
g = 26//4
print(g)

#Law of precedence sample 1
h = 10*2+3*5
print(h)

#Law of precedence sample 2
i = 10*(2+3)*5
print(i)

#Greather or equal
j = 3>=2
print(j)

# Less than
k = 5<3
print(k)
