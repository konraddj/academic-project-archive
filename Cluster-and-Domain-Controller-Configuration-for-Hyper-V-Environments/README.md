# Cluster and Domain Controller Configuration for Hyper-V Environments

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides comprehensive technical instructions for building and configuring a cluster environment with clustered shared storage and a Domain Controller. This SOP is intended for the client's technical personnel responsible for the setup and management of these systems within a Hyper-V virtualization environment. The objective is to deliver a detailed, step-by-step guide to ensure a smooth and efficient implementation of the production environment.

## Critical Tasks Covered

1. **Prerequisites Verification**
   - Verify hardware requirements and resource accessibility.

2. **Domain Controller Configuration**
   - Configure network settings and set up Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

3. **Cluster-Building Process**
   - Set up servers, configure network settings, and connect to shared storage.

4. **Hyper-V Cluster Setup**
   - Select features, and configure high-availability settings such as Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV).

5. **Verification Testing**
   - Validate Domain Controller functionality, cluster operation with shared storage, and successful failover of services between cluster nodes.

6. **Automation**
   - Use PowerShell where feasible to automate tasks and ensure consistency.

## Scope

This SOP provides detailed technical instructions specifically for environments using Hyper-V as the virtualization platform. It covers all necessary steps from prerequisite checks to the final testing and verification of the cluster environment. The SOP is designed to ensure a successful deployment of clusters with clustered shared storage.

## Output

This SOP is a detailed PDF report that serves as a template for constructing and managing a Cluster Shared Storage environment. It integrates precise PowerShell commands with illustrative screenshots to provide a clear, step-by-step guide for administrators and technicians.

The SOP includes:
- Step-by-step procedures for cluster setup and maintenance.
- PowerShell commands to automate and manage the cluster environment.
- Visual aids such as screenshots for key tasks and procedures.

Understanding the cluster architecture, responsiveness, and resiliency is crucial for achieving the project's goals of resource optimization and continuous availability.
